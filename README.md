# redstone-bus-mod
Essentially instant redstone wire. 
Acts like a repeater with no delay. 
Max 512 bus length. 
If you really need longer, separate buses by a redstone wire or a repeater to save some frames.
That being said, this mod should be way more efficient than fake instant redstone lines with BUD detectors.
It should also be more efficient than redstone itself because its signal is directional.

Mod comes with a wand which you left click on a redstone bus to set an anchor, then right click looking down the imaginary line where you want the redstone bus to be.
If there is no block beneath where the redstone wire will be placed, it copies the block beneath the anchor.
